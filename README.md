Not usable yet still work in progress.

What needs to be done:
- [ ] Get video details proberly(getting duration doesnt work on other formats other than mp4?)
- [ ] Fix the weird gap there is between the media element and the right border
- [ ] Properly scale video editor when increasing/decreasing window size
- [ ] Implement timeline
- [ ] Implement the editor
- [ ] Add hotkeys for the editor
- [ ] More robust process for ffmpeg/ffmprobe binaries. Maybe even integrate libraries instead?
- [ ] Rewrite the image extractor part. Currently it gets the first frame of the video and stores it in a folder.

This is how it currently looks like:
